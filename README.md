# var t;

Inspired by [Jenn Schiffer]()'s art+javascript examples, I interprate art and make them work with 99%* JavaScript. See the original vartworks on [vart.institute](http://vart.institute/)

I'm a sucker for great design, and highly appreciate art, though just above average in knowledge about art.

I'm also a sucker for JavaScript, and work as a contracting web developer. You might not see the quality shine through my *vart t;* project, as I try to build as quickly as I can (I really have to throttle myself, as I'm a fascist).

My vartworks are open-source, feel free to fix my shit if you want ;)
